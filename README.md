### Reflection
We gained a lot of insightful knowledge related to statistics in this project and significantly enhanced our analytical skills. Within our study, we applied conceps from the Probability an Statistical Data Analysis course to real-life problems. We learn how to do RStudio to analyze sample data, which we believe will benefit us in the future.
